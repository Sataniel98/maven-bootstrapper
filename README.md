# Maven Bootstrapper
This is a simple bootstrapper for Maven projects.

Just dump mvnbt.jar (and build.bat) into the root directory of any Maven project.

## Requirements
The only requirement is JDK 8. The project to build may still demand a higher version. Maven doesn't need to be pre-installed (which is the entire point of this).

Developers should remember to add `*apache-maven-*` to their .gitignore.
